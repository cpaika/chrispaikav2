<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>By default, society will gently, comfortably, guide us into is unhealthiness. Lay on the couch, watch another show, have another beer. We eat too much crap, drink too much poison, and live sedentary lives lacking daily vigorous movement. I love my father, but I wouldn’t call him healthy - if that’s my future, I need to do better.</p>

<p>You’re likely feeling the same way I do - a sense of light shame at your health, the mild anxiety that your late 20’s body isn’t as resilient as when you were a teenager. Your body looking slightly off from where you want it to be in the mirror.</p>

<p>This document is an outline of a new path I want us to go down together. We’re going to assemble ourselves into a squad to accomplish radical behavior change - taking our existing health habits and moving them to a world where we naturally, happily, make healthy choices. </p>

<h3>Some History</h3>

<p>Do you all remember when we would do 6k’s in crew? That sense of dread the day of. The anxiety building as you got on the erg, everyone screaming at you as you began to hit that last 1k. The all out push at the last 500, hitting 5 meters and basically falling off the seat. The glow of accomplishment later when you knew you literally couldn’t have pushed your body harder.</p>

<p>What made that possible? What if you made one of us do a 6k alone back then, in an empty boathouse with no watching? Do you think they would try as hard as physically possible? </p>

<p>When approaching the darkest moments of a 6k, without people watching and yelling at us, we all would have given up. There would be no motivation. Motivation came from the group, the friends around you yelling and pushing you on, who would be disappointed if you gave up. That magic made us better than we could have thought possible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the effort we were taught to exert was too much. It was unsustainable, it was painful, it probably wasn’t healthy. None of us did any recreational sports later in our lives - I’m going to take a wild guess and say that crew contributed to that. It’s unfortunate that we all didn’t integrate those lessons into our lives as we got older.</p>

<p>But exercise, a focus on health - it can be fun. That same group drive can be harnessed, in a way that’s motivating and yet positive, to help all of us get there. Google Crossfit and look at the people doing it - I don’t care what you have to say about Crossfit, don’t they look happy and healthy?</p>

<h3>Group Goals</h3>

<p>Collectively bootstrap each other from an unfortunately stable sedentary state, to a stable health-focused state where exercise and nutrition are mindfully pursued in alignment with deliberate values. Each of us will do some form of exercise, and some form of food tracking with the goal to jumpstart all of our journeys to becoming permanently more fit.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Get gud</p>

<p>This is a one time, one way structured journey together, from our current state of habits, to a new stable state where making healthy decisions an exercising is the norm. If any one of us gives up, our journey falls apart. So when we commit, we all need to commit knowing that this journey is an important one and we’re going to prioritize it in our life. This isn’t going to be easy, but it’s going to be fun. </p>

<h3>Who can join?</h3>

<p>Anyone who currently feels unhealthy. Ideally you don’t currently have an exercise routine or track your nutrition as those as skills we are going to build together.</p>

<h3>How much time will this take?</h3>

<p>At a minimum, 5-10 minutes a night for journaling and 1 hour once a week for a synchronous group meeting - 1.5 hour per week. </p>

<p>Add in the exercise and any additional nutrition tracking, that brings us to somewhere around 5-7 hours per week. This is a commitment - some daily activity will need to be outsourced, ignored, or dropped entirely from your life to make space. Time for exercise doesn’t come out of thin air. We only have this one body, it’s important to spend time taking care of it.</p>

<h3>Schedule</h3>

<h4>Kickoff</h4>

<p>The intention of the kickoff is to align each of us so we can begin the journey. We will briefly discuss logistics:</p>

<ul>
	<li>High level goals</li>
	<li>Schedule and end dates</li>
	<li>Structure of weekly sync meetings</li>
	<li>Group spreadsheet system for tracking qualitative/quantitative metrics and nutrition</li>
</ul>

<p>We will then do a discussion where we deep dive into each our personal guiding documents, and their mission statement.</p>

<h4>Weekly Check In &amp; Plan</h4>

<p>Each of us will share their progress and struggles in the past week, along with their goals for the upcoming week. This is a chance for each of us to check in with ourselves and see if we are making progress.</p>

<h4>Dates</h4>

<p>Sunday, January 2nd -Kickoff &amp; Share Personal Documents</p>

<p>Sunday January 9th - Weekly Check In &amp; Plan</p>

<p>Sunday January 16th - Weekly Check In &amp; Plan</p>

<h3>Pre-Kickoff Homework: Prepare our personal guiding manifestos</h3>

<p>In the week before the kickoff, each of us should brainstorm and write to themselves a document with the broad outline of their health goals during this period. We should strive to be honest with ourselves - these goals should be reasonable. </p>

<p>Here’s some good questions to get you thinking. Your welcome to skip them other than #3 and #9 but I found them helpful:</p>

<ol>
	<li>What are some health-adjacent parts of your life that you currently think aren’t going well?</li>
	<li>What have been past difficulties and pitfalls on your fitness journey?</li>
	<li>What are your fitness goals during this journey? Limit yourself to three goals at a maximum.</li>
	<li>What habits or changes will you implement to build towards your goals?

		<p>These habits will change over the course of the program as we all experiment to see what works for us.</p></li>
	<li>For each of your goals, what is a good measurable metric that you can use as a proxy to see your progress?

		<p>Set yourself up for success - these should be easy to track and not require a lot of effort.</p>

		<p>Examples:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Goal: Improve energy levels during the day. Proxy metric: Record a 1-5 on your energy levels in the afternoon.</li>
			<li>Goal: Lose fat. Proxy metric: Record your weight once a week</li>
			<li>Goal: Get better sleep. Proxy Metric: Wear a sleep tracker to log your sleep, or manually record a 1-5 of how you slept and a rough guess of how many hours each morning.</li>
			<li>Goal: Run a 9 minute mile. Proxy metric: Using your phone, track your mile split every time you run. </li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>This journey is going to take time out of the day - how are you going to make space for it?

		<p>Examples:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Outsource existing tasks to get back time (example: instead of doing laundry, get a wash and fold service)</li>
			<li>Stop or reducing current activities - easy examples are stopping mindless internet usage, stop watching youtube videos, etc. Look at your phones usage or screen time metrics for insight into small things that can get you back time. </li>
			<li>Stopping drinking, smoking, etc, so you get better sleep.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>What will your first weeks exercise plan be? 

		<p>Remember - we are not 18. Our bodies can’t just jump into heavy exercise - injuries are most common at the start of a fitness journey. Slow safety is number one - we only get this one body for the rest of our lives. </p>

		<p>Examples could be: </p>

		<ul>
			<li>Walking 30 minutes three times a week</li>
			<li>Daily stretching</li>
			<li>Yoga</li>
			<li>Bodyweight routine</li>
			<li>Running </li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>How will you track your diet?

		<p>This is the most varied one. We should all at least record what we eat during the day just with a sentence or two in a nightly note or journal. Some people may want to track macros or calories its all up to you. Being mindful about our food is key to fitness - you can’t be fit, happy, or mentally active if you’re eating crap. Food is literally medicine.</p></li>
	<li>Mission Statement. Synthesizing all the information above, put together a 3-5 sentence guiding paragraph for the next two months.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, all of us should take a shirtless fully body progress pic of their front and back to mark the start of the journey. (Jokes on you guys, this is all one big psyop so I can get shirtless pics of you all)</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Let’s get healthy. If you want to begin this journey together, message me to let me know. Please provide feedback on the structure and goals if you can think of any improvements. Yell at me if you think this is too much structure and there’s ways to make it simpler.</p>
